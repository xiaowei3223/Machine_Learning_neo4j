    "## Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "Collaborative filtering is based on the idea that people like things similar to other things they like, and things that are liked by other people with similar taste.   \n",
    "协同过滤是基于这样一种理念，即人们喜欢与自己喜欢的东西相似的东西，以及与自己有相似品味的人喜欢的东西。\n",

    "## PageRank and Personalized PageRank\n",
    "\n",
    "PageRank is an algorithm that measures the transitive influence or connectivity of nodes. It can be computed by either iteratively distributing one node’s rank (originally based on degree) over its neighbors or by randomly traversing the graph and counting the frequency of hitting each node during these walks.  \n",
    "PageRank是一种度量节点间传递影响或连通性的算法。它可以通过在相邻节点上迭代分配一个节点的秩(最初基于度)来计算，也可以通过随机遍历图并计算在这些遍历过程中击中每个节点的频率来计算。\n",
    "\n",
    "Personalized PageRank (PPR) is a variant of this algorithm that is biased towards a set of source nodes. It is often used as part of building recommender systems.  \n",
    "个性化PageRank (PPR)是该算法的变体，它偏向于一组源节点。它经常被用作构建推荐系统的一部分。\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2: Article recommendations with Personalized PageRank\n",
    "In this exercise, you will gain experience using the PageRank algorithm, understand the difference between PageRank and PPR, and use PPR to suggest relevant articles to an author.  \n",
    "在本练习中，您将获得使用PageRank算法的经验，了解PageRank和PPR的区别，并使用PPR向作者推荐相关文章。\n",
